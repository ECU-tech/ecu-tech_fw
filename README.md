# [ECU-TECH: Free Open Motorsports ECU](https://www.ecu-tech.tech/)

Welcome to ECU-TECH, a project intended to provide OEM quality open source engine controls and [free software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) with a focus on user-friendly design, stability and ease of use. 

ECU-TECH intends to narrow the gap between the features and functions seen on modern OEM engine control systems and that expected from stand-alone engine control systems. At the same time ECU-TECH intends to improve the ease of working with these systems and help provide access to the learning resources needed to understand and tune engines effectively.

ECU-TECH came about from a desire to enhance the user experience of rusEFI that was shared by a number of members of that project; over time it became apparent that the best way to achieve this goal was to begin working on a fork. Thus at the start of 2023 ECU-TECH was founded.

The founding members would like to express gratitude towards rusEFI for its ground breaking work and the innovation it has brought to the ECU market.

At present ECU-TECH shares a large amount of its core with the rusEFI project and most rusEFI boards are compatible with the ECU-TECH software; this is likely something that will continue to diverge over time, meaning full compatibility with older RE hardware cannot be guaranteed.
